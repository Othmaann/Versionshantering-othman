            Repository: A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.” It
            can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You
            can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository
        </p>
        <p class="Branch">
            Branch:a Branch is a code change, each project can have different Branches and it the official working version of
             your project, so if you have a project and want to change or add things, for example, you do a branch
             or if you have a classmate who wants to add something, they do it but an industry and the industry you use
             does not directly change the original projects. Once you have made the changes you want to make, you can merge yours
             Break back into your project to publish your changes.
        </p>
        <p class="Clone">
            Clone: When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls
            down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions
            of every file and folder for the project.
